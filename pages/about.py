# INTRODUCTION 
st.header("üìñ Introduction & Objectives")
st.write("""
EasyCraterSim is a scientific simulation tool designed to model the formation of impact craters on different planetary surfaces.
It allows users to estimate crater characteristics based on an impactor‚Äôs properties and to perform inverse simulations to determine the possible impactor for a given crater.

The project was developed as part of the **Mathematical Modeling course** under the supervision of **E. L√©ger and H. Massol**, at **Universit√© Paris-Saclay**.
It is based on established **impact cratering physics** and empirical scaling laws from geological studies.

# METHODO
st.header("üß™ Methodology")
st.write("""
The simulation relies on **empirical scaling laws** and **hydrodynamic models** to estimate the final crater morphology.
It takes into account:
- Gravity and surface density of the planetary body.
- Velocity, density, and size of the impactor.
- Energy dissipation and excavation mechanics.

The approach follows classical impact cratering studies, including those by **O‚ÄôKeefe & Ahrens (1999)** and **Holsapple (1993)**.

# HOW
st.header("üñ•Ô∏è How EasyCraterSim Works")
st.write("""
The simulation consists of two main modes:
1. **Single Crater Simulation**: The user inputs the impactor properties, and the program calculates the resulting crater.
2. **Reverse Simulation**: The user inputs a known crater properties, and the program estimates the properties of the impactor.

The model includes:
- **Energy of impact** estimation.
- **Transient and final crater dimensions** calculation.
- **Comparison with real impact craters** to estimate similarity.
