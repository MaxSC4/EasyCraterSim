**EasyCraterSim** is a lightweight numerical simulation tool designed to model the formation and evolution of impact craters based on the equations and methodologies described in the paper:
***O'Keefe, J. D., & Ahrens, T. J. (1999). Complex craters: Relationship of stratigraphy and rings to impact conditions. Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, 104(E11), 27091-27104.***
This project aims to provide a simple and accessible visualization of crater growth dynamics based on fundamental physical parameters.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Scientific objectives
- Understand the processes involved in impact crater formation.
- Model the transition between simple and complex craters *(WIP)*
- Study the influence of physical parameters such as gravity, impactor velocity, surface strength, and planetary density.
- Visualize the evolution of a crater profile over time, normalized by impactor diameter.

# üìä Features
- Choose pre-set crater types (Chicxulub, Meteor Crater, Tycho, Copernicus, and more).
- Customize key physical parameters (gravity, impactor size, velocity, angle, temperature, etc.).
- Visualize the crater shape at a specific time or animate its evolution.
- Graphical output showing normalized radius and depth of the crater.
- Download a GIF showcasing the evolution of the crater
- Choose between **Single Crater Simulation** or **Comparison Mode** *(WIP)*
- **ReverseSimulation :** Choose a crater and EasyCraterSim will estimate the impactor's parameters!
- **Guess the crater :** A quick game where you have to guess the crater based on hints!

# üß† Work in progress
- **Comparison Mode :** A new mode able to compare two craters, either side by side or by overlaying

# ‚öôÔ∏è Context
This program was developed as part of the course unit 'Mathematical Modeling,' supervised by E. L√©ger and H. Massol, during my Bachelor's degree in 'Earth and Universe Sciences' at the University of Paris-Saclay.
This project is based on the equations and impact crater formation models described in:
***O'Keefe, J. D., & Ahrens, T. J. (1999). Complex craters: Relationship of stratigraphy and rings to impact conditions. Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, 104(E11), 27091-27104.***
